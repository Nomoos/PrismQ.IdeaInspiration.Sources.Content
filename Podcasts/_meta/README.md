# _meta

This directory contains project-level metadata, documentation, and organizational materials for the Podcasts Source module.

## Structure

- **_scripts/** - Quick start and setup scripts (run.bat, run.sh, setup.bat, setup.sh)
- **docs/** - Module-level documentation (source specifications, guides)
- **issues/** - Issue tracking and project management (new, wip, done)
- **research/** - Research materials, experiments, and exploratory work
- **tests/** - Module-specific test files and test data

## Purpose

The `_meta` folder serves as a centralized location for module metadata that doesn't belong in the main source code directories. This keeps the module root clean while providing a clear location for:

- Module-specific documentation
- Issue tracking workflow
- Research and experimental work
- Planning and roadmap materials

## Note

This structure follows the same pattern as the repository-level `_meta` directory at the root of PrismQ.IdeaInspiration.
